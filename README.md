## UX

### Project Goals

The main goal of W&W Academy is to provide a multimedia platform for people that want to ineract with YouTube videos by creating playlist, so that a user can come back any time and access playlist and refer to its own comments and notes. It will be a fully responsive website, with a minimalist design and a logical easy to follow structure.

### Visitor Goals

We applied [Agile User Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apOvF9NVguA) aproach, in order to refer to an end goal expressed from the software userâ€™s perspective.

<!-- The target audience for this website could be anyone,  -->

The target audience for this website is a user that interacts with multimedia and YouTube videos and want: 

- To attach the video to the written text
- To create playlist of videos
- To start video on particular time to avoid watching unwanted material
- To reference and collate their notes and videos in one place
- To store a playlist of videos for particular topic of interests
- To retrieve, edit or delete saved playlists

### Developer Goals

As a developer the aim is to create a web application that will:

- Be responsive, interactive and dynamic
- Be a great addition to the portfolio
-

### Design

The goal of the design is to relate to YouTube red colour scheme. Keeping that in mind the design choices have been made to interfere as little as possible with the main subject matter.

#### Colours

The main colours used in this project for the logo, buttons and font was: ??? TBC;

This contrasted well against black and white and added enough interest to the design without making it too distracting.

#### Font

![TBC Font](assets/images/read-me/roboto-font.png)

The font chosen was XX TBC because it has a clean, modern type that would go well with the minimalist theme.

#### Styles
### Wireframes

The following wireframes were created on the skeleton plane as part of the planning process of the project using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

- [User Page](src/images/userpage.png)
- [Playlist Page](src/images/playlistpage.png)

## Product (USP)

Attaching video clips to written text so the user can watch a video as a reference and collate their notes and videos in one place.

- Example: if you wanted to learn about flask, you would write down the points you want to study and attach the clip of a video that refers to that area specifically. 

    So you could have several videos for the main topic of flask but each clip is only referring to the particular study point. These videos can be played manually or auto played and the notes associated with the video will be displayed with the clip.
